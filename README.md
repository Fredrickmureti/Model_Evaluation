#Model Accuracy Evaluation
This repository contains code to evaluate the accuracy of a machine learning model. The code uses various metrics to evaluate the performance of the model on a given dataset.

Purpose
The purpose of this code is to help users evaluate the accuracy of their machine learning models, and to identify areas where improvements can be made. The code includes a range of metrics that can be used to evaluate model accuracy, and is designed to be flexible and adaptable to a range of different use cases.

Models and Data
The code can be used to evaluate the accuracy of a range of different machine learning models, including classification and regression models. The code requires a dataset in CSV format, with separate files for training and testing data.

Metrics
The code includes a range of metrics for evaluating model accuracy, including precision, recall, F1 score, mean absolute error, and mean squared error. Users can specify which metrics they would like to use for evaluation.

Dependencies
The code requires Python 3.x, as well as the following Python packages:

pandas
scikit-learn
Usage
To use the code, users should clone the repository and run the evaluate.py script. The script takes as input the paths to the training and testing data files, as well as the name of the model file to be evaluated. Users can also specify which evaluation metrics they would like to use.
